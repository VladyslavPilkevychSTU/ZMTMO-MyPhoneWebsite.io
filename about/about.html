            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Realme was first mentioned in 2010 when it was known as OPPO Real, when
                OPPO Electronics introduced a new line of OPPO Real smartphones. On July 30, 2018, former Oppo Vice
                President Sky Lee announced his official departure from Oppo and his intention to establish Realme as an
                independent brand on Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo. As a result, after the separation in
                2018, Realme became an independent brand owned by the parent
                company BBK Electronics. Although Realme was launched by the company in May 2018 as a sub-brand intended
                for developing
                countries, and primarily the Indian market, as early as July 2018, Realme smartphones began to be
                produced without mentioning OPPO on the body of devices. According to the report of the international
                authoritative analytical agency Counterpoint Research, in
                the third quarter of 2019, Realme's global shipments amounted to 10 million units, which is more than
                800% more than the same period last year. The company is the 7th leading mobile phone manufacturer in
                the world. In 2021, Realme became the fastest growing brand in the world, reaching 100 million shipments
                faster
                than any brand in the history of the global smartphone market. In the fourth quarter of 2021, according
                to Counterpoint Research, Realme became the fastest growing brand in the 5G smartphone segment, up 165%
                compared to 2020.</p>
