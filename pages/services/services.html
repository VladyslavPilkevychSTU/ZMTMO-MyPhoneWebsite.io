                <p>Realme is a Chinese smartphone manufacturer that’s only a little over two years old. It’s part of BBK
                    Electronics Corporation, which has a complicated history spawning brands like iQOO, and the better
                    known OnePlus, Oppo and Vivo. Realme was created in a similar way to OnePlus, built as a separate
                    brand from BBK and Oppo, but given access to Oppo’s IP, economies of scale for buying components, as
                    well as its extensive factory lines. While OnePlus doesn’t featured in the top ten list of
                    second-quarter shipments at all, and Oppo has taken a hit in terms of devices shipped, Realme
                    appears to have flourished.</p>

                <p>Online support is a web-based form of delivering a customer service. Nowadays, it is a very popular
                    form of contacting company, more popular than visiting a company or a phone call. Online support is
                    also a part of customer relationship management.
                    The best advantage of an online support is a 24 hour-a-day customer service. Customers or website
                    visitors can easily contact the customer representative, when a problem occurs or when they have
                    some questions about the product or service.</p>

                <p>In a mobile-first world, people expect answers at their fingertips. They turn to the nearest device
                    to make a decision, learn something new, or get something accomplished. Connecting the dots across
                    these micro-moments is necessary for marketers to tell a single story across devices, channels, and
                    formats. Here are new cross-device insights to help you build a strong mobile strategy.
                    The proliferation of devices has changed the way people interact with the world around them. People
                    freely move back and forth between devices to get things done. And they're more tethered to those
                    devices than ever before. Here's a snapshot of how cross-device users turn to their phones,
                    computers, and tablets in a given day.</p>

                <p>Television, sometimes shortened to TV, is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images
                    and sound. The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission.
                    Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.
                    Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but only after several
                    years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an
                    improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and
                    the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions.
                    During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the
                    mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.</p>
